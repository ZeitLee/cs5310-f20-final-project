# CS5310 Final Project

## Description:
For CS5310 Computer Graphics Final Project.
A 3D Greeky Snake prototype.

## Control:
Clicks button to move cube to collect items.
Also can use WASD to move mian cube.
IJKL to rotation the camera.

## Accomplishment
- One canvas: to show main scene.
- One 3D geometric shapes: Cube.
- One perspective projection: Shader matrix multipliaction.
- One camera
- One directional lighting.
- Two user interactions: keyboard and buttons to control Cube and camera.

## TODO list

### Set of Requirements:
- Two more 3D geometric shapes: Only have cube now. Implement two new geometric. (Different geometric represents different ability, such as X2 points or +10 seconds).
- Three 3D mesh objects: Add this feature, thinking to implement this object for main character and obstacles.
- Three Textures: For collecting objects, add textures.
- One more User Interactions???
Keyboard interaction to control camera rotation and main character movement.
Button interaction to control camera rotation and main character movement.
Question: Are these count 2 or 4???

### Additional requirements:
- Additional Canvases: Mini map top view.
- Animation: Rotation about collecting objects.
- Shadows: can see objectsâ€™ shadow on ground.
- Texture: can choose texture of main character.
